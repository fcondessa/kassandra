# kassandra
Tensor prediction using convolutional decomposition.

Given two tensors (X and Y) Kassandra learns the mapping between them using a collection of filters such that the mapping between X and Y such that Y can be predicted from X.
This is done in a two step fashion:
1) Decompose X as a finite sum of convolutions of synthesis filters with
