# kassandra
Tensor prediction using Convolutional Bayesian networks.

Given two tensors (X and Y) Kassandra learns the mapping between them using a collection of filters such that the mapping between X and Y such that Y can be predicted from X.
If Y is a time-shifted version of X, then Kassandra allows us to predict Y from X.
